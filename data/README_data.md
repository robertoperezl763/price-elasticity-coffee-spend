## üîó Notes

- All records in `sbux_transactions.txt` are for users who **enrolled** in the rewards program (`enroll = 1` in `sbux_survey.txt`).
- Use the `id` column to **join** the two datasets.
- The survey dataset enables **correction for selection bias** using Heckman‚Äôs two-step regression.
- Gender and enrollment are represented as **binary integers** (`0` or `1`), not booleans.

## üìé File Format

Both datasets are in **tab-delimited `.txt`** format.
