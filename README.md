What factors infleunce how much consumers spend each mont? How sensitive are customers to changes in pricing?
Are we missing insights by only looking at the customers who entroll?

## 🔍  Tehcniques Used
- **Log-log regression** (elasicity modeling)
- **Heckman 2-step regression** (to correct for selection bias in data)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization**
- **Business impact analysis** based on model predictions

---

## 📊  Key Findings
- A **1% increase** in average drink price leads to a **1.775% decrease** in spend
- **Female customers** spend **~7x more** per month than male customers
- Each additional **year of age** leads to **~1.01%** increase to customer monthly spend
- Correcting for selection bias in data reveealed that the **price sensitivity** was hihger than initially estimated
