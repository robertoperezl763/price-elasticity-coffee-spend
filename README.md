# Price Elasticity and Customer Spend Modeling for a Coffee Chain

# Problem Statement:
What factors infleunce how much consumers spend each mont? How sensitive are customers to changes in pricing?
Are we missing insights by only looking at the customers who entroll?

# Tehcniques Used
- Log-log regression (elasicity modeling)
- Heckman 2-step regression (to correct for selection bias in data)
- Data Visualization for exploratory analysis and model interpretation
- Business impact analysis based on model

# Data Overview
- Features: gender

# Key Findings
- A 1% increase in average drink price leads to a 1.775% *decrease* in spend
- Female customers spend ~7x more per month than male customers
- Each additional year of age leads to ~1.01% increase to customer monthly spend
- Correcting for selection bias in data reveealed a *higher elasticity* than originally estimated

# Business Impact
Reducing average drink prices from the current average of $6 to $5 could generate an estimated $3.2 billion in extra global revenue per month
Female customers represent a higher value customer demographic. Worth tragetting marketing campaigns
